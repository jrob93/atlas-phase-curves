Use the files here to calculate phase curves for objects you already have data for.
Set up some directories:
mkdir data - place all observational data here
mkdir figs - location to save phase curve figure

You should set up a conda environment to ensure that package requirements are met.
See ../conda_envs for some examples.

python fit_phase_curve_centaur.py - calculate the phase curves and make plots

Analysis:
centaur_plots.ipynb - visualise the observational data
analyse_centaurs.ipynb - load and visualise the phase curve fits for all centaurs
